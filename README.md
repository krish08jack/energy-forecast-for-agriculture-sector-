Mid and long-term demand forecasting is a key aspect of power-system planning.
It is necessary when considering investments in new generation capacity and transmission and distribution
infrastructure.
Electricity demand forecasting is also a crucial aspect of policy formulation and monitoring, for regarding
energy-efficiency policies.
The history of energy and electricity demand forecasting, both in India and internationally, is rife with examples of
significant forecast errors.
The development of sensitivity analyses, scenarios, and periodic evaluation of the actual outturn of drivers of
electricity demand is crucial.
OBJECTIVE:

Sector wise demand forecast of Indian power sector.
Econometric demand forecast sector wise of Indian power sector up to 2030.

RESEARCH GAP:

The future will demand the use of more hybridized and probabilistic approaches to forecast the electricity
requirement more accurately.
CEA undertakes the study periodically based on historical data using established methodologies. The forecast
results are developed for distribution utilities, state, region and at a national level for short, medium and long-term
horizons. One of the observed gaps in the results of 18th EPS, released in December 2011, has been the YoY
variation between forecast and actual electricity requirement.
On average, the demand has been lowering by 5% on YoY basis. This has left the country with supply overhang
with a large newly added capacity distressed with no PPAs.

ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS:
These approaches are essentially based on economic indicators affecting load forecasting.
Econometric methods rely on the statistical historical time series analysis and cross section data to develop a model of peak
load or energy demand as a function of behavioral and structural variables such as economic activities, population and
weather.
These models relate the demand for electric energy to economic and demographic variables such as population, income,
electricity rate, GDP, electricity prices and per-capita income.
The major advantage of this approach is to provide detailed information on electricity future demand to better identify and
understand the factors that affect forecast uncertainty .
The disadvantage of the econometric approach is that, to be accurate, changes in electrical demand affected by factors
changes must remain constant in the forecast period as in the past.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS:
Regression is the one of most widely used statistical techniques for electric load forecasting.
Regression analysis is a set of statistical methods used for the estimation of relationships between a dependent
variable and one or more independent variables.
Regression methods are usually used to model the relationship of load consumption and other factors such as
weather, day type, and customer class. These models contain deterministic influences such as holidays, random
variables influences such as average loads, and exogenous influences such as weather.
Regression analysis includes several variations, such as linear, multiple linear, and nonlinear. The most common
models are simple linear and multiple linear.
